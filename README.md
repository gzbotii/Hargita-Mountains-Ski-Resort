A basic, responsive website, for a fictional ski-resort. It's features nav-bar in desktop and, and a hamburger menu in tablet and mobile view. Weather data updated via an API request. The nav is set-up to scroll to the desired section.

Built-up with the mobile-first principle in mind. The design followed initially, and later extended with the menu, carousel and with the footer: https://www.figma.com/file/GwRmx1FJ31evTNq6hpCpCs/Amazing-Mountain. The logo is a created in Adobe Express, usded as SVG, all other images are in webp format.

The weather data is fetched with an API call from OpenWeatherMap, location is set to Hargita mountains.

The footer is responsive as well, adapted to mobile, tablet, desktop. It feautures an on-hover animaiton on the footer list-elements. Social media logos are changing color on-hover.

A basic carousel added, using CSS.

GSAP is used for animation - the header has a timeline, other elments use the scroll trigger.

It features a Google Maps embed module, location set to the Hargita mountain, where this fictional resort is placed. 

Unfortunately because of some GitHub Pages issue, I cannot sort the project into folders (images, CSS, JS files).
