A basic, responsive website, for a fictional ski-resort. It's features nav-bar in desktop and tablet, and a hamburger menu in mobile view, weather data updated via an API request.

Built-up with the mobile-first principle in mind. My first project using CSS Grid. The design followed initially, and later extended with the menu, carousel and with the footer: https://www.figma.com/file/GwRmx1FJ31evTNq6hpCpCs/Amazing-Mountain. The logo is a created in Adobe Express, usded as svg, all other images are in webp format.

The weather data is fetched with an API call from OpenWeatherMap, location is set to Hargita mountains.

The footer is responsive as well, adapted to mobile, tablet, desktop. Basic on-hover animaiton added to the footer list-elements. Social media logos are changing color on-hover.

A basic carousel added, using CSS.

Unfortunately because of some GitHub Pages issue, I cannot sort the project into folders (images, CSS, JS files).
The project can be found at https://gzbotii.github.io/Hargita-Mountains-Ski-Resort/

JS code refactored based on the feedback. Should I add something else as well?
